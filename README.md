This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in PHP related to type juggling and comparisons with zero. The `bug.php` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version using strict comparison to avoid type juggling issues.  This bug can be especially tricky to detect, as it results in seemingly random behavior depending on the input.  The solution highlights the importance of using strict comparison operators to prevent unintended type coercion during comparisons in PHP.
